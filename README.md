This program prints any jpg or png image in ASCII characters.

This program uses PIL (Pillow).
If you have the PIL module installed, you can run printImage2.pyw given in the directory of this repo.
If you don't have PIL, you can run printImage2.pyw inside of the "printImage with PIL" folder.
This should access the module locally without an install.
